    "**Your answer:** As the value of lambda increases, larger weights are penalised even more heavily. This reduces the classifier's performance on the training set as seen by the decreasing training accuracy, but helps it to generalise better and reduce overfitting as seen by the increasing testing accuracy. However, past lambda = 1000, both accuracies start to decrease. This could be because the lambda value is too large and starts to overtake the impact of the weights, which prevents the classifier from learning meaningfully."
